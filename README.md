# real-frontend-m2m

working on the menu screens of app currently (since they aren't influenced by game choices or data collected)
* loading screen
* 3-step "tutorial" (intro 1-3 on figma)
* log in and sign up screens (can do later, after we work out user auth)
* home screen
* settings screen

we'll leave games and data screens for later
